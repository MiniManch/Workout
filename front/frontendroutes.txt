State Management with PINIA
Use PINIA to manage the state of the coach (and potentially other relevant data) throughout the application, ensuring it's accessible across screens without passing it through props or route parameters.
This structure divides the functionality into distinct screens accessible via their respective routes, focusing on user authentication, coach management, client management, session scheduling, and session details management. Using PINIA for state management ensures that data like coach details remains accessible across different parts of the application seamlessly.
